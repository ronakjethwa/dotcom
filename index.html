    <!-- Leisure -->
		<h2 class="header-margin top">Leisure Pursuits</h2>
		When he is not in front of a computer screen, he spends most of my time in socializing to meet like-minded individuals, photographing places and things or just catch up on reading.
    <p><b>Photography:</b> Ronak loves capturing moments through his lens. His picture collections include his travels, nature, architecture and at times tells life stories from his point of view. He regularly (tries to) post some of his memories on <a target="_blank" href="https://ronakjethwa.photos/">https://ronakjethwa.photos</a> with a brief story around it. </p>
    <p><b>Music:</b> Find some of the soul music playlists Ronak listenes to (and takes a lot of time curating) on his <a target="_blank" href="https://open.spotify.com/user/ronakjethwa">Spotify</a> profile.</p>
